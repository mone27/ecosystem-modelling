# Introduction to ecosystem-modelling
The model is a collection of notebooks written while learning ecosystem modelling.
It doesn't aim to be complete and is still very work in progress.

This is a (work in progress) implementation of a terrestrial ecosystem model. The aim is to have a model to learn ecosystem modelling, where each step and process is explained and documented not to have state of the art model. 

The model is implemented in Julia
